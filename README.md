### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸŒ± My name is Atuel, I'm a physicist who has always been in love with programming and computers.

ðŸ”­ It started as a hobby, but then I decided to take it more seriously. I took some computer science courses online and at my university, and I truly enjoyed them.

âš¡ Now, I'm looking forward to starting a PhD, applying data science for research in physics. I am eager to continue learning and applying my current knowledge in the field simultaneously.
