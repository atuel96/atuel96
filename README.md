### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸŒ± I'm a physicist who has always been in love with programming and computers.

ðŸ”­ It started as a hobby, but then I decided to take it more seriously. For my thesis, I wanted to work on something that combines both physics and computer science, and I accomplished that goal. 

âš¡Now I'm looking forward to working in the industry.
